## Tips

**Commit Policy** I'll only retain the latest commit of this repo. Therefore, you won't be able to browse history. But I'll state what changes I've made each time in CHANGELOG.md. This repo will be updated in-time during the process of the class taken.

**Made with Notions** Most of the notes are written with [Notions](https://www.notion.so/product?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=2075789713&utm_medium=80211061801&utm_content=372709093351&utm_term=notion&targetid=aud-1053779029641:kwd-312974742&gclid=CjwKCAiA1JGRBhBSEiwAxXblwYRKxpPsqTgNvjj7pp2kCAsaWKtZHUdpi2WEqYT-bUTjgEklkBTNSBoC65AQAvD_BwE). I just make pdf exports of these notes in public. If you want, you may request a copy of org-mode source code by sending email to me.

**Notes Availability** I decided to retain these notes on GitHub. All notes are only intended for ONLINE READING.

**Academic Integrity** I may attach some source code to better illustrate the ideas in notes. If you want to use these code snippets in your course work or course projects, you should cite the source clearly.

Also, here's some advice on using my notes.

My notes serve as an outline for a course. In these notes, I won't dive too deep into details.

- I prefer plain-text notes. If I have a figure to present, generally I would draw it with ASCII Flow, or I just refer to a figure in slides.
- Personally, I use these notes as a reminder of structure (or TOC) of a course. I would review these notes on a weekly basis.
- I'll also add my own thoughts into the notes.
- I enjoy discussing with my peers. I take record of Q&A in course. The answers are summed up from the professor, combining with my own knowledge.
- For final-term revision, I would make mindmaps from textbook and slides. This part will be uploaded when it comes to last few weeks of a semester.
